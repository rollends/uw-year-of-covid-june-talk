# Interactive Learning during COVID-19
**A Case Study in Remote Lab Delivery**

The pandemic-induced remote online learning environment compelled instructors to carefully, yet rapidly, contemplate effective design and delivery of practical labratory components.
Laboratory work both facilitates learning through hands-on experience, making the abstract ideas in the applied sciences more concrete, and inspires interest and curiosity.
Instructors had to find creative ways of substituting this hands-on learning experience in the remote environment that complements traditional assessments and inspires students in a time of disillusionment.
This talk will discuss the experience and lessons learned from designing a remote lab with these goals in mind.
